current UI shows 220 flights in 1 stop. here are the problems 

1. we see decimal in the stop tab, we must never have decimal 
2. we see decimal in cabin class pricing 
3. we see "USD" which was supposed to be "$" 
4. the 220 flights were supposed to be listed out, not grouped in until unless there is award or code-share available. heirarichy of flight is award must be parent to code-share, code-share must be parent to its alliance, other than that no further grouping is needed. if award is not available then code-share-parent and code-share alliances are the heirarchy. the UI must show intended collapsible UI, where each cllapsible level is intended further
5. we are NO LONGER grouping by time option or price option, all flight must appear as individual enteries unless they are point 4. 
6. we are fetching multiple cabins per each search, we must run these request in sequence and show progress, update/link each time we have payload.
