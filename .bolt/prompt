# description
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

# rules
1. By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
2. Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
3. In order to understand the api responses, see the responses folder. 

# rule for Knowledge base
1. each time you do or learn anything you must update kb.md on root folder.
